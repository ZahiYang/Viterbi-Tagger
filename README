Python implementation of a hidden markov model that uses the viterbi algorithm.

icvtag.py is a toy example that runs on the corresponding tagging/ic* data. These datasets correspond with Jason Eisner's viterbi spreadsheet, found here:
http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/papers/eisner.hmm-viterbi.xls 

which is described here:
http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/papers/eisner.tnlp02.pdf

vtag.py will run on the entraining/entest/endev data.
